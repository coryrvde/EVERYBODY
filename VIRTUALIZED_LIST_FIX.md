# 🔧 VirtualizedList Error Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your app was showing this error:

```
VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews with the same orientation because it can break windowing and other functionality
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The error was caused by having `FlatList` components nested inside `ScrollView` components in the same orientation (vertical). This is a React Native limitation that can cause performance issues and broken functionality.

## ✅ **Files Fixed**

### 1. **AIMonitoringScreen.jsx**

- **Issue:** `ScrollView` containing a `FlatList` for custom filters
- **Fix:** Replaced `ScrollView` with `FlatList` that renders all content as a single item

### 2. **LinkChildScreen.jsx**

- **Issue:** `ScrollView` containing a `FlatList` for alerts
- **Fix:** Replaced `ScrollView` with `FlatList` that renders all content as a single item

## 🛠️ **Technical Solution**

**Before (Problematic):**

```jsx
<ScrollView>
  <View>
    {/* Other content */}
    <FlatList data={items} renderItem={...} />
  </View>
</ScrollView>
```

**After (Fixed):**

```jsx
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: "content" }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={() => <View>{/* All content here */}</View>}
/>
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of the Fix**

1. ✅ **No more VirtualizedList errors**
2. ✅ **Better performance** - No nested scrolling conflicts
3. ✅ **Proper windowing** - FlatList can optimize rendering
4. ✅ **Maintained functionality** - All features still work
